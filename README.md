# The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Forecast

## Overview

This project contains a series of scripts and data folders for a comprehensive data analysis workflow. Each folder and file is organized to support tasks from data simulation to model building and replication. Below is an overview of the projectâ€™s folder structure and the purpose of each file.

## Directory Structure
The repo is structured as:

### `data/`

This folder contains various stages of data used in the project.

-   **00-simulated_data/**: Contains the initial simulated datasets for testing the analysis process.
-   **01-raw_data/**: Stores raw data files that are directly imported or downloaded before any processing.
-   **02-analysis_data/**: Holds data files that have been processed and structured for analysis.
-   **03-cleaned_data/**: Contains the final cleaned datasets used in modeling and analysis.

### `models/`

This folder is used to store the RDS files of the models generated in the analysis. Files are saved in the format `{Candidate}_{Method}_model.rds`, for example: - `Trump_linear_model.rds` - `Biden_Bayesian_model.rds`

### `other/`

Supporting documents and reference materials.

-   **datasheet/**: Contains metadata and additional documentation.
-   **literature/**: Stores literature references or related papers.
-   **llm_usage/**: Documentation on how large language models (LLMs) were used in the project.
-   **sketches/**: Visuals, sketches, or other representations related to the data and model insights.

### `paper/`

Contains the final research paper along with supplementary materials like figures or tables used in the publication.

### `scripts/`

Contains all the R scripts necessary for data processing, analysis, and modeling.

-   **00-simulate_data.R**: Generates simulated data for initial testing.
-   **01-test_simulated_data.R**: Tests the simulated data to ensure quality and integrity.
-   **02-download_data.R**: Downloads the raw data from specified sources.
-   **03-clean_data.R**: Cleans and preprocesses the raw data for analysis.
-   **04-test_analysis_data.R**: Tests the cleaned data to ensure it's ready for analysis.
-   **05-exploratory_data_analysis.R**: Conducts exploratory data analysis and creates visualizations.
-   **06-model_data.R**: Builds linear and Bayesian models for each candidate and saves the results.
-   **07-replications.R**: Script to replicate analyses and generate predictions for the models.

## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, Codriver. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatHorse and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
