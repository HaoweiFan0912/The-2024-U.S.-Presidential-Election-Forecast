# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

这里写数据来源，用到的R包。。。。。。

## Raw data
raw data一共有52个variables，以及15891条样本。
去掉重复variables，以及无关紧要的url,还有全空的varibales后还剩下以下variables以及description。
部分重要的在此显示，不重要的在appendix。
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-main_columns
#| tbl-cap: "Main column descriptions of the raw data"

# Define the selected variable names
selected_variables <- c("poll_id", "pollster_id", "sponsor_ids", "pollster_rating_id", "numeric_grade", "pollscore", "methodology", "transparency_score", "state", "start_date", "end_date", "sponsor_candidate_id", "sponsor_candidate_party", "question_id", "sample_size", "population", "tracking", "created_at", "notes", "source", "internal", "partisan", "race_id", "cycle", "office_type", "election_date", "stage", "nationwide_batch", "ranked_choice_reallocated", "ranked_choice_round", "hypothetical", "party", "answer", "pct")

# Create a tibble with variable names and descriptions
variable_tibble <- tibble(
  Variable = selected_variables,
  Description = variable_descriptions
)

# Define the variables to extract for the table of selected variables
variables_to_extract <- c("poll_id", "pollscore", "numeric_grade", "transparency_score", "start_date", "end_date", "sample_size", "population", "hypothetical", "methodology", "pct")

# Extract the relevant rows from the tibble
extracted_tibble <- variable_tibble %>% filter(Variable %in% variables_to_extract)

# Create the table using kable for selected variables
kable(extracted_tibble)
```
所有variable的na值
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-variable_na
#| tbl-cap: "Number of Missing Values and Percentages for Variables"
# Calculate the number of missing values for each selected variable
na_counts <- sapply(raw_data[ , selected_variables], function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# Calculate the percentage of missing values for each selected variable
na_percentages <- sapply(raw_data[ , selected_variables], function(x) mean(is.na(x)) * 100)

# Create a tibble for missing value counts and percentages
na_tibble <- tibble(
  Variable = names(na_counts),
  Missing_Values = na_counts,
  Percentage_Missing = round(na_percentages,2)
)

# Split the tibble into two halves for side-by-side display
na_tibble_1 <- na_tibble[1:ceiling(nrow(na_tibble)/2), ]
na_tibble_2 <- na_tibble[(ceiling(nrow(na_tibble)/2) + 1):nrow(na_tibble), ]

# Create the table using kable for missing values
kable(na_tibble)
```
重要的numerical variable的分布：
```{r, fig.pos="H", fig.width=22, fig.height=18}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-numdis
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of numerical varibales"
### Define Variables and Prepare Data ###
# Define the numeric variables to plot
numeric_variables <- c("pollscore", "numeric_grade", "transparency_score", "sample_size", "pct")

# Convert start_date and end_date to Date type
raw_data$start_date <- ymd(raw_data$start_date)
raw_data$end_date <- ymd(raw_data$end_date)

# Define the date variables to plot
date_variables <- c("start_date", "end_date")

### Create Plots for Numeric Variables ###
# Create a list to store plots
plots <- list()

# Loop through selected numeric variables and plot their distributions
for (variable in numeric_variables) {
  plots[[variable]] <- ggplot(raw_data, aes_string(x = variable)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.8, fill = "#69b3a2", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
    labs(title = paste("Distribution of", variable), x = variable, y = "Frequency") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 30) +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
    )
}

### Create Plots for Date Variables ###
# Loop through selected date variables and plot their distributions
for (variable in date_variables) {
  plots[[variable]] <- ggplot(raw_data, aes_string(x = variable)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 30, fill = "#69b3a2", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
    labs(title = paste("Distribution of", variable), x = variable, y = "Frequency") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 30) +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
      axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
    )
}

### Combine and Print Plots ###
# Combine all individual plots into one using patchwork with 2 columns and 4 rows
combined_plot <- wrap_plots(plots, ncol = 3, nrow = 3, heights = unit(rep(3, 4), "in")) +
  plot_annotation(
    theme = theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14)
    )
  )

# Print the combined plot
print(combined_plot)

```
接下来是categorical
```{r, fig.pos="H", fig.width=22, fig.height=8}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-catdis
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of categorical varibales"

### Plot distributions for categorical variables ###
# Define the categorical variables to plot
categorical_variables <- setdiff(variables_to_extract, c(numeric_variables, "start_date", "end_date"))
categorical_variables <- categorical_variables[categorical_variables != "methodology" ]
categorical_variables <- categorical_variables[categorical_variables != "poll_id" ]
# Create a list to store plots for categorical variables
categorical_plots <- list()

# Loop through categorical variables and plot their distributions
for (variable in categorical_variables) {
  plot <- ggplot(raw_data, aes_string(x = variable)) +
    geom_bar(fill = "#69b3a2", color = "black") +
    labs(title = paste(variable), x = variable, y = "Count") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  
  # Add plot to list
  categorical_plots[[variable]] <- plot
}


### Plot top 5 methodologies ###
# Extract top 5 methodologies by frequency
top_5_methodologies <- raw_data %>%
  count(methodology, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  pull(methodology)

# Create a new column to categorize methodologies into top 5 and 'Other'
raw_data$methodology_grouped <- ifelse(raw_data$methodology %in% top_5_methodologies, raw_data$methodology, 'Other')

# Plot the distribution of the top 5 methodologies plus 'Other'
methodology_plot <- ggplot(raw_data, aes(x = methodology_grouped)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#69b3a2", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Top 5 Methodologies and Others", x = "Methodology", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# Add methodology plot to categorical plots list
categorical_plots[["methodology_grouped"]] <- methodology_plot


# Combine all individual plots for categorical variables into one using patchwork
combined_categorical_plot <- wrap_plots(categorical_plots) +
  plot_annotation(title = "Distributions of Categorical Variables")

# Print the combined plot for categorical variables
print(combined_categorical_plot)

### Create a list for non-numeric variables ###
non_numeric_variables <- setdiff(variables_to_extract, numeric_variables)

```
#######注意，appendix其他的图还没画




















## Measurement
	
Some paragraphs about how we go from a phenomena in the world to an entry in the dataset.

## Outcome variables

Add graphs, tables and text. Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable or update the subheading to be singular.



Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}

```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

```{r}

```

Talk way more about it. 

## Predictor variables

Add graphs, tables and text.

Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable and feel free to combine a few into one if they go together naturally.





















# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.


# Results

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults.

# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Second discussion point

Please don't use these as sub-heading labels - change them to be what your point actually is.

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
